I have over 4 years of experience as a full stack developer, and have worked on various personal and team projects. I like making new things and solving problems. My favorite aspect of every job I've held in the past has been determining the needs of the team and developing or improving the system to fit those needs. Even when problem solving has not been part of my job description, I have found identifying and solving problems to be my key strength. I've also had a number of years of experience leading teams and developing training materials for other employees.
