The goal of this project was to have a tutoring system which allowed users to set up an account, create a profile, and schedule tutoring sessions with tutors.

Tutors can create accounts and create a public profile listing. Other users can then schedule sessions with that tutor directly from their profile page.

### Some of the key things I learned from this project are:
* React
* Redux
* Node
* Express
* Project Management
* NoSQL
* Cloud Deployment
